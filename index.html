                <h2>Hi, I'm Luca 👋</h2>
                <p>I remember you was conflicted, Misusing your influence, Sometimes I did the same, Abusing my power, full of resentment, Resentment that turned into a deep depression, Found myself screaming in the hotel room,
                    I didn’t wanna self destruct, The evils of Lucy was all around me, So I went running for answers, Until I came home, But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt, Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned,
                    Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was, But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one, A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination,
                    Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned, The word was respect, Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's, Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man,
                    Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets, If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us, But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga.</p>
